# Level Up
An exercise where students advance through levels of refactoring class components to use hooks.

## Instructions
As always, run `npm i` first.
Then, start Webpack using the `npm run build` command and the live server with the `npm run start`.
These are already configured to automatically update as you work on the repository.

All the exercises are located in the `client` directory.
It's highly recommended you start with Level One. The further up you go, the less instruction you'll receive in the comments. You're welcome.

Solution code with notes is in the `solution` directory.

### Good luck, have fun!
