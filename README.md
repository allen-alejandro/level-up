# Quote Dropper
A quick exercise where students refactor a simple React app to use the `useState` and `useEffect` React hooks.

## Instructions
Start Webpack using the `npm run build` command and the live server with the `npm run start`. 
These are already configured to automatically update as you work on the repository.

All the exercises are located in the `client` directory. 

It is recommended that you work in this order: `App.jsx` > `Message.jsx` > `RefreshQuoteButton.jsx` > `Clock.jsx`

Solution code with notes is in the `solution` directory. 

### Good luck, have fun!
